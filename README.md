# Divergence
Calculating Divergence in Apodemus 


This repository contains the script used to calculate sequence divergence using SNP data.
Also inluded are some test files which the script can be run on, these files are SNP data from A.flavicollis and A.sylvaticus. 
The script does not require the user to obtain the same number of sequenced SNPs per loci. 
This script works on a binary bases thus can be used on any sequencing data. 

Also included is script to calculate Divergence Time, to extract highest and lowest divergent sequences (to be used for BLAST comparison) and script to plot the results.
