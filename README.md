# Divergence
Calculating divergence for Apodemus 


This repository contains the script used to calculate sequence divergence using SNP data.
Also inluded are some test files which the script can be run on, these files are SNP data from A.flavicollis and A.sylvaticus. 

The script does not require the user to obtain the same number of sequenced SNPs per loci.
